# Readme

The repository contains the files I use to configure a new installation of OS X/macOS to my liking.  Feel free to clone/fork and alter to your needs.

## Usage

On first run you need to do `make init`

On subsequent runs just `make main`

Check out `manual.md` for manual installation steps

# Contribution

Should someone think of a better way to handle a portion of this installation, a pull request or feature suggestion would be greatly appreciated.
